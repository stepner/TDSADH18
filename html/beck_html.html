		<h2><center> Article Title: When Babies Die: What Do the Numbers Mean?</center></h2>
		<p>
		The article that we chose is looking at why there was an
		increase in infant mortality in the 90â€™s. A lot of the people 
		in this neighborhood lived at or below the poverty line, therefore, many 
		people were not able to afford health care. People who live in this neighborhood 
		have to much money for medicare, but not enough to pay for health care. 
		Since people are not getting health care, they go to the doctor less, and children
		with a weaker immune system have better chance of dying. Also, lack of public awareness
		and public programs contribute to why there was such a high mortality rate. We chose this
		article because we saw its title was when babies die, and we were intrigued. &#x1F648;
