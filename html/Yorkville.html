<br>correct suburban fashion, on the high banks of 
<br>the noblle Hudson; but Yorkville had mystery 
<br>and interest of a richer flavour, commanding the 
<br>passageway to the Sound, bordering on the tur-
<br>bulent waters of Hell Gate, and overlooking the 
<br>islands in the East River.
<br>The boundaries of Yorkville have been vari-
<br>ously described.  From all accounts of nucleus
<br>of the village seems to have llain along the olld
<br>Post Road between Eighty-third and Eighty-
<br>ninth Streets; while its expansions included the 
<br>district east of Fifth Avenue to the river from
<br>Fifty-ninth to One Hundredth Street.  The 
<br><br>nomenclature of the features of the East River
<br>shore is romantic and suggestive. Kip's Bay
<br>indented the eastern bank of the river at about 
<br>the location of the present ferry slips at Thirty-
<br>fourth Street; it was here that the British landed,
<br>when they took possession of the city, on Sep-
<br>tember 15, 1776, while the quick-witted wife of 
<br>the owner of Incleberg prepared a feast for their
<br>detention.  Until 1851 the old farmhouse of
<br>Jacob Kip, who gave his name to the bay, stood
<br>on Second Avenue near Thirty-fifth Street.
