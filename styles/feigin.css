/*
This is a Cascading Style Sheet--or Style Sheet. The code is called, and the extnsion for the file is, CSS.
This style sheet should be copied and modified, and "attached" to your HTML file. The line in the header of the HTML template that
 attaches this style sheet is this one: 

<link href="../styles/template.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

Your code should have a similar line, but with the name of your style sheet.
Note that the "tags" for commenting are not the same in HTML as in CSS.  Above and below these comments are the comment "tags."
The best way to learn about style sheets is to change settings and see what happens!

/*
Style sheets give the browswer specific formatting to use for each element of the web page. Anything left out of the style sheet will
be displayed using the browser's settings. (In other words, the style sheet overrides the browser's settings.)
The format for describing the format is to list the HTML tag, followed by code surrounded by curly brackets like these: {}
The following code tells the web page to use an Open Sans font that is sized 12px, on a light green background.  It should be 
applied generally to all displayed text (unless overridden by a more specific tag).
*/
html {
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  background-color:  #33FFBD;
}

/*
Here is where the "Large Headline" format is set (60px font, centered, shadows, etc).
*/
h1 {
  font-size: 60px;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px 0;  
  color: #00539F;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px black;

/*
HTML tags can be combined. Here, the paragraphs and list items are formatted the same.
*/
p, li {
  font-size: 16px;  
  line-height: 2;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}

/*
The formatting for the body specifies the width withing the page that the content will appear, sets the background to a shade of lavendar 
(overridding the HTML light green), and creates a blue border (in addition to creating "padding" or blank space at the edges).
*/
body {
  width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color:#f7dcea;
  padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;

/*
Images will be formatted as "blocks" (as opposed to in-line), with rounded corners and no margin between the image and nearby text.
*/

  display: block;
