A Blurring of Boundaries Between Two City Areas
===
By KIRK JOHNSON

Defining the exact border between Manhattan neighborhoods such as Yorkville and the Upper East Side<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> can be a tricky business<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, complicated by history, local pride, real estate values and wishful thinking.

Generally, Yorkville is considered to extend from 79th to 96th Street and from either Lexington or Third Avenue to the East River. But since land values are generally higher if they can be associated with the chic Upper East Side name, developers building in fringe areas tend to disregard the old boundaries and take the name that promises the highest value.

As a result, during the current wave of construction north of 90th Street, Yorkville appears to be shrinking while the Upper East Side is growing. One of these projects, on Second Avenue between 93d and 94th Streets, is about to begin marketing, and the developer is trying to have it both ways.

The project, called Astor Terrace, is situated, according to its promotional literature, ''in the heart of Manhattan's vigorous new Upper East Side.'' At the same time, a major selling pitch for Astor Terrace is relative affordability and more space for the money than can be found in the more traditionally defined Upper East Side area.

Although one side of the marketing strategy is pure perception - the idea that everyone wants to live on the Upper East Side - the other side is quite concrete: Property prices were lower in this part of Manhattan when the site was purchased last year.

In fact, the land was vacant, and the developer, Solomon Equities, has filed for a 421A tax abatement, arguing that the property was underutilized. The project, to be completed early next year, consists of a 32-story tower plus two sets of six attached town houses - a total of 291 units.

''We're selling the idea of space, quality and amenities at an affordable price,'' said Jean Solomon, who is a partner with her husband, David, in Solomon Equities.

Mrs. Solomon, the project manager for Astor Terrace, said relatively inexpensive land prices - less than $20 a square foot for a 48,000-square- foot parcel - have allowed the construction of larger and somewhat less costly apartments at this site than could be built in more coveted areas of the Upper East Side.

This is not to say that the apartments are inexpensive.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> In the tower, Mrs. Solomon said, prices will start at ''less than $300 a square foot.'' That compares with $500 or more a square foot for housing in the most desirable areas of Manhattan and close to $400 a square foot for much of the Upper East Side. The three-story town houses, which are being constructed around an enclosed inner courtyard between 93d and 94th Streets, will cost more, although offering prices have not been set because the State Attorney General's office is still reviewing the prospectus.

But on the basis of the apartment sizes in the tower - which range from 760-square-foot, one-bedroom units to 1,620-square-foot, three-bedroom units - prices could be expected to range from about $200,000 to $450,000.

Such prices are still a bit of a shock in this part of Manhattan, where abandoned storefronts only a block north on Second Avenue are littered with trash and wine bottles.

Two years ago Civitas, a citizens' group, filed a lawsuit to try to force the city to conduct an environmental impact study of development on the block between 93d and 94th Streets and between Second and Third Avenues, arguing that high-density projects such as Astor Terrace and Carnegie Park - a rental project also under construction on that block - could overload the neighborhood. Civitas lost the suit.

According to community boards in the area - 94th Street divides the Upper East Side's Board 8 from East Harlem's Board 11 - five large projects north of 90th Street either are in progress or are expected to start within the next year.

One of them is a 1,297-unit development occupying a full square block off 95th Street, for which plans have been filed by Milstein Properties. A large proportion of the projects is expected to be market-rate rental housing.

All this construction will undoubtedly change the character of the upper Yorkville area, but the Solomons still have had to contend with a good deal of decay on Second Avenue just north of their project.

They have responded, in part, by making the Astor Terrace tower face inward. The idea is to create what they call a ''complete community.'' The main tower entrance will be inside the block from a private inner drive, while the two rows of town houses will have their entrances on 93d Street and 94th Street, with terraces overlooking the courtyard. On the Second Avenue side, 15,000 square feet of street-level space will be leased to commercial tenants. The project was designed by Schuman, Lichtenstein, Claman & Efron.

Fifty-two percent of the apartments are one-bedroom units, while 33 percent have two bedrooms and 11 percent have three bedrooms. The town houses, with two bedrooms and a third-floor greenhouse, are about 1,700 square feet.
