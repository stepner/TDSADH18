<br>correct suburban fashion, on the high banks of 
<br>the noblle Hudson; but Yorkville had mystery 
<br>and interest of a richer flavour, commanding the 
<br>passageway to the Sound, bordering on the tur-
<br>bulent waters of Hell Gate, and overlooking the 
<br>islands in the East River.
<br>The boundaries of Yorkville have been vari-
<br>ously described.  From all accounts of nucleus
<br>of the village seems to have llain along the olld
<br>Post Road between Eighty-third and Eighty-
<br>ninth Streets; while its expansions included the 
<br>district east of Fifth Avenue to the river from
<br>Fifty-ninth to One Hundredth Street.  The 
<br><br>nomenclature of the features of the East River
<br>shore is romantic and suggestive. Kip's Bay
<br>indented the eastern bank of the river at about 
<br>the location of the present ferry slips at Thirty-
<br>fourth Street; it was here that the British landed,
<br>when they took possession of the city, on Sep-
<br>tember 15, 1776, while the quick-witted wife of 
<br>the owner of Incleberg prepared a feast for their
<br>detention.  Until 1851 the old farmhouse of
<br>Jacob Kip, who gave his name to the bay, stood
<br>on Second Avenue near Thirty-fifth Street.

<br>There was an old house at Horn's Hook,
<br>belonging to Mrs. Provoost, taken by Archibald
<br>Gracie, who built on the site the so-called
<br>" Gracie House,"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> now included in the East
<br>River Park. This house in its day saw inter-
<br>esting life and extended princely hospitality, for
<br>its owner was a merchant and shipowner of

<br>wealth and had excellent connections in this
<br>country; his son married the daughter of Oliver
<br>Wolcott. Josiah Quincy describes a dinner which
<br>he attended in the Gracie House in 1805. Wash-
<br>ington Irving was a frequent visitor, and the
<br>exciled king of France, Louis Philippe, is said
<br>to have been entertained here.
<br>Before the rocky bottom of the river was blown
<br>up at the point where the Harlem and East River
<br>tides collide in their rapid action, the waters of 
<br>Hell Gate were a formidable feature of the 
<br>navigation at this point. The Gracie House over-
<br>looked this prospect, and Quincy speaks of the 
<br>shores of Long Island as full of cultivated llands
<br>and elegant country seats. John Jacob Astor's 
<br>villa adjoined the Gracie estate, and Washington 
<br>Irving describes this delighful retreat, " opposite 
<br>Hell Gate," where he retouched and perfected 
<br>his "Astoria," written at Astor's request. 
<br>The spectacular entrance of the Queensborough 
<br>Bridge, united New York with Ravenswood, in 
<br>the borough of of Queens, has made terrific changes
<br>in this once peacful locality. One of the most 
<br>cruel is the partial destruction of that charming 
<br>realization of *Pomander's Walk*, the Riverview
<br>Terrace, a row of dwellings built directly on the 
<br>top of the rocks facing the river, andd cut off from

<br>all contamination by gates at each end, guarded 
<br>by a private watchman. Perhaps I feel towards
<br>this pretty block with especial tenderness, from 
<br>personal associations, for a certain house in the 
<br>terrace, held by an early schoolmate of my father,
<br>figures in my earliest and lates recolelctions of 
<br>New York. This charming old gentlemen has 
<br>been one of the stoutest defenders of his rights
<br>against the invasion of the enterprises connected
<br>with the construction and maintenance of the 
<br>bridge, which has taken to itself half of the
<br>houses. The bridge has brought many annoy-
<br>ances but contributes an amazing note to an 
<br>already exhilarating view of the river, the island,
<br>and the passing craft.
