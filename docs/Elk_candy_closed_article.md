86th Street Loses German Holdout And Its Marzipan
===

&nbsp;Customers spilled out of Elk Candy onto 
the sidewalk in front of 240 East 86th Street 
a week before Easter. More than 500 a day 
were coming for homemade marzipan and 
chocolate confections -- bunnies, eggs and 
pigs. A sign in the window said the 64-year-old 
shop was closing for good.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>


   
&nbsp;''The line wouldn't break,'' said Anton 
Lulgjuraj, the 24-year-old owner, who inherited 
the shop from his father.
&nbsp;All that was left on the shelves that bleak, 
snowy afternoon were paper doilies and a 
few boxes of prepackaged chocolates. Relatives 
and friends helped him clean up and 
move fixtures and machinery into storage.
&nbsp;Elk, which closed last Monday, was the 
last holdout of the Montgomery, a row of 
four-story tenements built in 1883, and the 
penultimate vestige of German Broadway, 
as East 86th Street was known. Dozens of 
German establishments, including Kleine
Konditorei, Cafe Geiger, the Lorelei dance 
hall, the Platzl restaurant and Cafe Wienecke,
are gone. Only Ideal Restaurant is left
on 86th Street, between First and Second
Avenues, where it relocated two years ago
after a fire. Several German establishments
remain in other parts of Yorkville.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>


&nbsp;A developer, the Related Companies, 
bought the Montgomery and the six-story 
Manhattan, No. 244, next to it, from FGH 
Realty in February. The developer expects 
demolition of the Montgomery to begin this 
week. A 22-story luxury building with 245 
rentals and 40,000 square feet of retail space 
is to be built on the site by the end of 1998.

&nbsp;''I don't know where I'm going to get 
marzipan for Oma now,'' said Arturo 
Gruenebaum, 29, referring to his grandmother. 
He sadly entered the empty shop 
with his cousins, Nancy and Anthony Weiss
of Tampa, Fla. and a friend, Anusch Cutujian,
of Hamburg, Germany.
   &nbsp;"I came in to get marzipan piggies for my
niece," said Mr. Weiss who stopped by
whenver she was in town. 
&nbsp;''This is marzipan,'' Mr. Gruenebaum
said. ''It was an institution.''

&nbsp;Mr. Lulgjaraj, of Albanian descent, inherited
the secrets of marzipan and chocolate-
making from his father, Leka, who worked 
at Elk for 27 years, and bought it from
Swiss-born Albert W. Hadener in 1990. Mr. 
Hadener bought the shop from the original 
owners, the Kramers, in 1961. Elk stands for 
Elizabeth and Ludwig Kramer. Mr. Lulgjaraj
said he would look for another site in
Yorkville to reopen.

&nbsp;Among the last customers was Kathy 
Jolowicz, a Yorkville historian. She picked 
up two cartloads of candy for the Zion St. 
Mark's Church's spring bazaar on Saturday. 
Ms. Jolowicz, who grew up in Yorkville, 
recalled little care packages her mother 
used to sent her several decades ago at 
boarding school in Tarrytown.

&nbsp;''She sent me chocolate candies,'' Ms. 
Jolowicz said, ''with different colored sprinkles
-- nonpareils -- and lebkuchen.

&nbsp;Jane Schnitzer, who moved to the neighborhood
in 1974, always gave her eldest 
daughter, Annabel, marzipan for Easter<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">2</a></sup>, 
Christmas and Valentine's Day.

&nbsp;''I literally raised her on marzipan,'' said 
Ms. Schnitzer, whose daughter went to 
Brearley, on 83d Street, and is now a freshman
at Barnard College. ''An awful lot of 
kids at Brearley will be disappointed.'' <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">2</a></sup>ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY
