&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By GAY TALESE


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a serene brownstone. <br/>
on Lexington Avenue, on the. <br/>
corner of Eighty-second Street,<br/>
a 59-year-old pharmacist named<br/>
Frederick  D.  Lascoff  has spe-<br/>
cialized for years  in  selling<br/>
leeches to battered prize-fight-<br/>
ers, catnip oil to lion hunters<br/>
and thousands of strange po-<br/>
tions to people in exotic places<br/>
around the world.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lascoff drugstore, which<br/>
celebrated its sixtieth anniver-<br/>
sary last week, is a  Gothic-<br/>
styled apothecary shop whose<br/>
walls are lined with more than<br/>
50,000 bottles containing every-<br/>
thing from Acacia to zinc.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not be inferred from<br/>
the foregoing that Mr. Lascoff's<br/>
apothecary shop  carries  only<br/>
rare herbs and weird pills; far<br/>
from it. the bulk of its business <br/>
comes from standard prescrip-<br/>
tions. But through the years J.<br/>
Leon Lascoff & Son has made a<br/>
reputation for producing bi-<br/>
zarre concotions when re-<br/>
quested.<br/>
**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighters Steady Customers**<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prize-fighters wishing to have<br/>
blood sucked from their facial <br/>
wounds have been some of Mr. <br/>
Lascoff's  steadiest  customers.<br/>
And when the African explorer <br/>
Martin  Johnson  was  off  to<br/>
hunt  lions,  he  first equipped <br/>
himself with catnnip oil from the <br/>
druggist. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of the most unusual <br/>
requests  came from another <br/>
drugstore  owner, who  once <br/>
wrote Mr. Lascoff to ask: "Can <br/>
you please tell me what I can<br/>
do to make my drugstore smell<br/>
like  a  drug  store?"  Seems<br/>
that food odors in his establish-<br/>
ment overpowered the desirable<br/>
"drugstore smell."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Mr. Lascoff evolved  a<br/>
formula  of  phenol,  valerian, <br/>
asafetida and iodoform;  and,<br/>
sure enough, it gave forth a <br/>
drugstore scent. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Lascoff  establishment<br/>
never has needed such a for-<br/>
mula, because it has long had <br/>
a ban in foods, soda fountains<br/>
and  other  un-pharmaceutical<br/>
items common in many drug-<br/>
stores.   Its  two-sstory. main <br/>
chamber is void of jukeboxes,<br/>
pay telephones, cigarettes, pa-<br/>
perback novels and comic books.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J. Leon Lascoff & Son was <br/>
founded a couple of blocks away <br/>
from its present site by the <br/>
elder Lascoff, who died in 1943. <br/>
Dr. J. Leon Lascoff, <br/>
born in Russia,  arrived  in the United<br/>
States in a Prince Albert coat <br/>
and silk hat and took a job in<br/>
a drugstore  at $2 an hour. <br/>
Among other things, he washed <br/>
windows.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Firm Founded in 1899**<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started his own firm in <br/>
1899, a year before the birth <br/>
of his son, the present owner, <br/>
Dr. Frederick D. Lascoff.  The <br/>
latter also has a son, Fred Jr.,<br/>
22 years old, now working in <br/>
the apothecary and making con-<br/>
siderably more as an appren-<br/>
tice than his ancestores--without<br/>
washing windows. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this is not one of New <br/>
York's oldest drugstores (it is<br/>
debatable which is), the J. Leon<br/>
Lascoff firm has an interna-<br/>
tional trade that includes royal-<br/>
ty, the rich, and far-flung hos-<br/>
pitals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It moved to its present spot <br/>
on Eighty-second Street in 1931<br/>
--on ground that formerly was<br/>
a saloon.  This seems strangely<br/>
fitting, because all during Pro-<br/>
hibition a familiar slogan was:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old little gin mill don't you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cry, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll be a drugstore by and <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by."



**FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES: Empty whisky bottle, <br/>
a memento of Prohibition days, stands on a shelf at the<br/>
Lascoff Drugstore on upper Lexington Avenue. The label<br/>
indicates that the prescription--required in those times--<br/>
called for four daily doses of two teaspoonfuls each.**
