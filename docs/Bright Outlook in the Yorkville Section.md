**Chances for Speculators Along the Lexington Ave. Subway Route**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles H. Schnelle, secretary of the House and Real Estate Owners' Association, says the realty furture of the Yorkville section is very bright. Along the route of the Lexington avenue subway there is need of up-to-date apartment houses, and there speculative builders will be able to put up many high class apartment houses. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some model houses of this class are under way in this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Realty in the section has been considerably benefited by the building of the Queensboro Bridge," says Mr. Schnelle, "and if plans for the bridge to span the Hudson River are carried out Yorkville will have two spendid river highways connecting the New Jersey and the Long Island shoes. It is impossible to estimate accurately the manifold benefits which such connections will bring to this great section of the city. The more we are brought in closer touch with suburban New Jersey and Long Island the greater will be the realty vigor of the old Yorkville section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lexington avenue spur of the subway is expected to stimulate realty buying in a much larger degree than in recent years throughout the entire section. The subway places the great theatrical and shopping centres of Manhattan on a direct line with the Yorkville district. Besides, the subway will make it possible for hundreds of families living in the Yorkville flathouse sections to more quickly reach to various flourishing centres of upper New York, especially in The Bronx.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Within recent years the upper Park avenue section, which is one of the most delightful residential parts of Yorkville, has undergone a big transformation. It has been changed from an inaccessible dwelling house region into one of the strongest and most populat apartment house areas of the greater city.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Its development along these lines is just in the initial stage, and when the Lexington avenue subway is in operation it will be superbly located as a place of residence. For years it suffered from the noise and smoke nuisance of the old Park avenue tunnel. But with the changing of the motive power of the trains using the tunnel from steam to electricity the smoke and noise nuisance was removed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is needed, and it may not be very long before it becomes a reality, is a crosstown subway between the East River and the West Side. Except at the two extreme ends of Yorkville, or on 86th street, where there is a trolley service to Eighth avenue, there is no direct connection with the West Side. With this proposed subway to connect the two main lines of Lexington avenue and Broadway wonderful improvements could be expected. A practical solution has already been presented to the Public Service Commission in a plan to create a loop beginning at the Battery, to run up Lexington avenue to 86th steet, and through 86th street and Central Park, then down Broadway, giving this section a local as well as an express service and to all points further uptown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With these improvement (and all are practical) carried out, great future possibilities can be expected from this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Investors and builders will do well to consider the future of this, one of the sagest and most steady sections of this great city.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yorkville is an historic district. When New York began to grow rapidly northward from the old Knickerbocker districts many of the well-to-do families sought a suitable place for a summer home on Manhattan Island. At that time no section offered more rural advantages than Yorkville.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The district is bounded by Fifth avenue and the East River, 57th and 100th streets, and was traversed years ago by the old Boston Post Road, now Third avenue. The Boston Road was one of the principal thoroughfares running north and south throughout the entire length of Manhattan Island.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a result of the growth, both in a business and residential way, in the lower part of New York, the Astors, Gracies, Primes, Lawrences, Beekmans, Rhinelanders, Rikers, Pauldings, Brevoorts, Provosts, Joneses, Schermerhorns and other well known families bought large tracts of land in the Yorkville district.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the homes of old Knickerbocker families of New York, which were built in the early part of the nineteenth century, were still standing in good condition along the East River about twenty-five years ago, and here and there might then be seen a few isolated truck gardens.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 80's many thrifty persons, most of whom were of German descent, bought plots in the Yorkville section and erected on the site small houses. The majority of the houses were of four stories. Later five story flathouses were built in the section, and soon afterward numerous factories were established there. It was along the river front that most of the industrial concerns were built soon after the district began to attract the heads of factories. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this tenement and factory building was taking place east of Third avenue, the westerly half of the section was being transformed into the choicest home district of New York. And since that time in the upper Fifth avenue section have been the homes of many persons prominent in society and business circles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not many years ago the old-fashioned horsecar disappeared from this section. The transit facilities of Yorkville first comprised horsecar lines, next followed elevated roads, then cable cars, then trolleys, and now the entire region is being permanently linked to the great subway routes of New York by the building of the Lexington avenue subway line.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To-day Yorkville is a thickly populated and thriving section of the city. It has manufacturing concerns of many kinds, small and large department stores, more than six popular theatres, handsome clubhouses, numerous banks, trust companies and saving instritutions, and a large number of flourishing churches. A few old landmarks still remain of the days when Yorkville was most suitable for summer homes. In the northeasterly section, fronting on the East River, is the house built by Archibald Gracie in 1813. It is surrounded by several acres of beautiful trees and shrubs. The house and land comprise one of the city's finest breathing spaces, known as Carl Schurz's Park.
