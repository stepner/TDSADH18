&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---------- <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dream early yesterday morn-<br/>
ing,Bertrand Lascoff, 20 years old,<br/>
a pharmacist,   crept. to. the  bed<br/>
where  his father slept   in   their<br/>
apartment at 200 West Ninety-third<br/>
Street  and stabbed him   eight<br/>
times. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father, Joseph D. Lascoff,<br/>
60, a druggist on the West Side for<br/>
many years, is in Reconstruction <br/>
Hospital, where surgeons last night<br/>
seemed to think his condition criti-<br/>
cal.   He had wounds in the back,<br/>
chest and both arms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When detectives questioned young<br/>
Lascoff right after the attack, he <br/>
seemed still to be in the dream<br/>
state.   He said his temples throbbed,<br/>
and mumbled something about his<br/>
father "staring" at him through the dark in the room where they<br/>
slept. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**No Warning of Attack** <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I felt." he murmered, "that he <br/>
had no love for me; that he was  <br/>
selfish. And his eyes in the dark, <br/>
grew larger and larger." <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudley J. Lascoff,   an elder<br/>
brother, told reporters that there<br/>
had  been  no. differencces  between<br/>
Bertrand  and  their  father;   no<br/>
warning that Bertrand was under <br/>
a nervous strain.  He was inclined<br/>
to attribute  his brother's  act to<br/>
overstudy.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bertrand, he said, went through <br/>
a long period of intensive cram-<br/>
ming a few months ago, in prepa-<br/>
ration for his examination for a <br/>
pharmacist's license.   There  was<br/>
no outward sign, though, to indi-<br/>
cate to the family that this had af-<br/>
fected him.  When he went to sleep<br/>
at 11 P.  M.  tuesday he seemed<br/>
normal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bertrand, tall, thin and appar-<br/>
ently of a naturally nervous tem-<br/>
perament, told Detectives Theodore<br/>
Beckler and James walsh of the <br/>
West 100th Street station that the<br/>
strange  nightmare,  or   hallucina-<br/>
tion, disturbed his sleep about 3 <br/>
A.  M.  He got out of bed and went <br/>
to the kitchen for a breadknife.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently no one heard him<br/>
moving about; not even his father,<br/>
asleep in the same room with him.<br/>
In other parts of the five-room<br/>
appartment Mrs. Sadie Lascoff, his<br/>
mother, and his brother,  Dudley, <br/>
were fast asleep. Bertrand returned <br/>
to his own room.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Pursues Father Through** <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the father awoke.  The<br/>
knife had found him in the dark. <br/>
He ran about in terror.  with Ber-<br/>
trand close behind, stabbing repeat-<br/>
edly.  Before the lights were on the <br/>
chase had taken them through all<br/>
five rooms, and Bertrand, still as <br/>
if in a dream, had wandered into <br/>
his mother's room.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly he laid down the knife. <br/>
It was some time before he seemed <br/>
to realize what had happened. Then <br/>
he shook all over.   Policemen, <br/>
called by neighbors, held him as <br/>
Dr. Murphy of Knickerbocker Hos-<br/>
pital dressed the father's wounds.<br/>
