**IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT LIVING IN: Yorkville**
----
By Barbara Preseley

LIKE many parts of Manhattan, the area <br/>
known as Yorkville finds that its <br/>
distinctiveness as a neighborhood is fading.<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;''When you said 'Yorkville' it used to <br/>
mean something,'' said Assemblyman Al- <br/>
exander B. Grannis, a Democrat-Liberal <br/>
who represents the neighborhood. ''But <br/>
now it's just a physical place; the name <br/>
doesn't mean much anymore.'' <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;But perhaps because gentrification <br/>
started in Yorkville decades ago, before <br/>
there was even a word for the concept, the <br/> 
neighborhood seems to have developed <br/> 
resilience. In the face of the growth and <br/>
development that have blurred the line <br/>
between Yorkville and its glitzy neighbor <br/>
to the south of 79th Street, the Upper East <br/>
Side, Yorkville seems determined to rede- <br/>
fine itself. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;''It's an area that for a while lost its <br/>
sense of community,'' said David Stern, <br/> 
director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood <br/>
Association, a social agency that serves <br/>
the area. ''One of the negative conse- <br/>
quences of gentrification was that it com- <br/>
pletely tore the social fabric.'' <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;But he thinks the fabric is well on <br/> 
the mend, and for that he gives much credit <br/>
to the young urban professionals who, <br/>
having settled in droves in Yorkville's <br/>
new high-rises, plunged into the neighbor- <br/>
hood's civic organizations. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;They come to an area overflowing with <br/> 
new living space. A dozen new buildings <br/> 
with about 2,300 units have opened in the <br/> 
last several years, and Yale Robbins, the <br/>
real estate research and publishing comp- <br/>
any, says that least 10 with more than <br/>
1,300 apartments are either on the way or <br/>
proposed. Developers have marched the <br/> 
traditional northern border from 86th <br/> 
Street to 96th Street by convincing poten- <br/>
tial residents that the extra 10 blocks is <br/>
the upper Upper East Side. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Residents can quickly enumerate York- <br/>
ville's virtues: the mix of people, the <br/>
convenience of having ''everything at <br/>
your fingertips'' and, especially, the pock- <br/>
ets of Old World culture that survive from <br/>
the time decades ago when Yorkville was <br/>
a lively blue-collar community dominated <br/>
by residents of German background. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;The German presence in Yorkville <br/> 
dates to the late 18th century, when Ger- <br/>
man immigrants settled near what is now <br/>
86th Street. In the early 19th century, <br/>
wealthy New York families, including <br/> 
several of German descent, established <br/>
country estates in the area; later in the <br/> 
century, the estates yielded to urbaniza- <br/>
tion and were gridded into city blocks. <br/> 
German families then moved uptown <br/>
from the Lower East Side, and in the peak <br/> 
years of European immigration, York- <br/>
ville became the destination for waves of <br/>
immigrants, including central Europeans <br/>
and Irish as well as the Germans. <br/>

&nbsp; Many ended up working in the area's <br/> 
breweries and frequenting the cafes, beer <br/> 
halls and social clubs along 86th Street. <br/> 
Before World War II, Yorkville was home <br/> 
to several pro-Nazi groups, including the <br/> 
national headquarters of Fritz Kuhn's <br/>
German American Bund. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;One of Yorkville's more famous resi- <br/>
dents, the late actor James Cagney, was <br/> 
honored last Tuesday when Mayor Ed- <br/>
ward I. Koch signed a bill designating <br/> 
East 91st Street between Second and <br/> 
Third Avenues as James Cagney Place. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;YORKVILLE'S decline as a distinct <br/> 
enclave began with postwar real <br/> 
estate development on the East Side <br/> 
and was speeded greatly by the 1956 <br/> 
razing of the Third Avenue el, which <br/> 
removed a demarcation point between <br/> 
Yorkville and the silk stocking district to <br/>
the west. The latest wave of development <br/>
has inspired resistance by community <br/>
advocates to what they describe as the <br/>
''canyonization'' of the area's avenues <br/>
with high-rises out of proportion to the <br/>
neighborhood's scale. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;''I was standing at the corner of 88th <br/>
and Third,'' said Carolyn <br/> 
Greenberg, who lives on <br/> 
88th Street. ''The radio <br/> 
had said it was sunny. I <br/> 
couldn't tell.'' <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;Ms. Greenberg, who is <br/> 
the new director of Rea- <br/> 
son (Rezone Eastside <br/> 
Arterials/ Save Our <br/> 
Neighborhood), advo- <br/> 
cates a ''short and fat, <br/> 
not tall and skinny'' ap- <br/> 
proach to new buildings. <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;Residents have been <br/> 
successful in getting <br/> 
midblocks on east-west <br/> 
streets downzoned, to <br/> 
maintain their residen- <br/> 
tial character. The City <br/> 
Planning Commission is <br/> 
rezoning the 86th Street commercial area <br/> 
to require contextual development. The <br/> 
impact of replacing vacant lots and gas <br/> 
stations with multi-unit residences is evi- <br/> 
dent in congestion on public transporta- <br/> 
tion, and in the traffic jams on the avenues. <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;''Suddenly you have all these new build- <br/> 
ings where people never existed before,'' <br/> 
said Tony Morenzi, an aide to Assembly- <br/> 
man Grannis. ''Nobody really knows how <br/> 
many people live here anymore.'' <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;The count is made more difficult be- <br/> 
cause in the new buildings, many young <br/> 
people share. At Normandie Court, where <br/> 
the campus-like atmosphere seems de- <br/> 
signed to ease the transition from college <br/> 
to adult life, studios start at $1,150 and <br/> 
one-bedrooms at about $1,295. Also widely <br/> 
available, for upwards of $1,200 monthly, <br/> 
are subdivided apartments in walk-up <br/> 
tenement flats once inhabited by local <br/> 
workers and their families. <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;Yorkville is no exception to the overall <br/> 
stagnant Manhattan co-op and condomin- <br/> 
ium market, said Greg Young, the vice <br/> 
president for residential sales at J. I. <br/> 
Sopher, the real estate company. <br/> 
''There's a lot on the market right now in <br/> 
Yorkville, with some good buys,'' he said. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Postwar one-bedroom co-ops west of <br/>
York Avenue range in price from $200,000 <br/> 
to $500,000; new luxury condominiums <br/> 
range from about $160,000 to $300,000. <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;Only the enclave of East End Avenue is <br/> 
removed from the hurly-burly of transi- <br/> 
tional Yorkville. The prices on one-bed-<br/> 
room co-ops, which rarely turn over, <br/> 
range from $300,000 to $600,000. This is the <br/> 
neighborhood of Carl Schurz Park, one of <br/> 
Yorkville's few greeneries, where Mayor <br/> 
Koch lives in Gracie Mansion. <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;RESIDENTIAL development in the <br/> 
northern part of Yorkville has <br/> 
spurred a rejuvenation of stores <br/> 
along the avenues above 86th Street. <br/>
Storefronts, some of which had been <br/> 
boarded for years, have suddenly blos- <br/> 
somed into such restaurants as E'cco-la <br/>
at 93d Street and Third Avenue, and video <br/> 
pstores and press-on nail shops. Many <br/>
small antiques shops in the neighborhood <br/> 
seem so far to have survived commercial <br/> 
rent increases. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;What little is left of the German and <br/> 
Austro-Hungarian empire is evident on <br/> 
86th Street, between Second and Third <br/> 
Avenues, where the Cafe Geiger and the <br/> 
Ideal Restaurant represent, respectively, <br/> 
the formal and informal approach to Ger- <br/> 
man cuisine. For Hungarian food, there is <br/> 
Mocca on Second Avenue between 82d <br/> 
and 83d Streets. It may say something <br/> 
appealing about the neighborhood that the <br/> 
health food store on 86th Street is boarded <br/> 
up, while the Marzipan Store next door <br/> 
seems to be thriving. <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;On East 82d Street, between Second and <br/> 
Third Avenues, are other reminders: the <br/> 
Puski-Corvin Magyar Konyveshaz, a <br/> 
Hungarian book and record store. Next <br/> 
door, is the New York Psychoanalytic <br/> 
Institute, where spiritual descendants of <br/>
Sigmund Freud tend to egos and ids. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Religious institutions have played a <br/>
major role in preserving Yorkville's cul- <br/>
tures and in responding to need. Down the <br/>
block from the Hungarian bookstore, on <br/>
East 82d, is the Hungarian Reform <br/>
Church, offering services in Hungarian. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Many churches and synagogues have <br/>
food or shelter programs for Yorkville's <br/>
estimated 1,400 homeless. The quiet gar- <br/>
den and French Gothic-style architecture <br/>
of the Episcopalian Church of the Holy <br/>
Trinity, on 88th Street between First and <br/>
Second Avenues, offers an unexpected <br/>
refuge from urban life. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Yorkville is home to some of New <br/>
York's elite private schools, including <br/>
Chapin and Brearley, and at certain times <br/>
of the day the streets are clogged with <br/>
youngsters wearing prep-school plaid. <br/>
Parents who cannot afford a prep school <br/>
or do not choose to send their children to <br/>
one have the choice of St. Joseph's Roman <br/>
Catholic elementary school or Public <br/>
Schools 198, 158, 151 or 190. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;In P.S. 190, on 82d Street, between First <br/>
and Second Avenues, is the Lab School for <br/>
Gifted Education, an innovative seventh- <br/>
and eighth-grade program. The Lab School <br/> 
has a computer link with Moscow school <br/>
that allows students to do joint science, <br/>
history and social studies projects. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Yorkville children who stay in the pub- <br/>
lic schools traditionally go to Robert Wag- <br/>
ner, the East Side's only junior high <br/>
school, and on to one of the city's academ- <br/>
ic or specialized high schools. <br/>
