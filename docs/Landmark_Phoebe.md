   What Does It Take To Make a Landmark?

**C**all the city and suburban <br/>
Homes a block of tenements and it<br/>
does not seem like a natural can-<br/>
didate for landmark status. Call it <br/>
utopian housing, however, and it <br/>
begins to look a lot better. And utopian<br/>
housing is recisely what this is - since this <br/>
sprawling series of structures, which runs <br/>
along the south side of 79th Street from York <br/>
Avenue to the East River, is one of the most <br/>
ambitious attempts in the history of New<br/>
York to create viable housing for the poor. <br/>
Together with its neighboring complex, the <br/>
Cherokee Apartments, the City and <br/>
Subruban Homes stands as perhaps our<br/>
greatest legacy from a critical moment in <br/>
both the architectural and social history of <br/>
the city - a monument to the moment <br/>
when a solution to the city's housing prob-<br/>
lems actually seemed possible. <br/>
   In he first decade of this century, when the <br/>
1,300-unit complex was erected, the city <br/>
faced a catastrophic housing crisis. <br/>
Cramped, dark and dirty tenements were the <br/>
norm for the city's poor, many of whom lived <br/>
in the conditions that can barely be called civi-<br/>
lized. Social reformers took up the cause of <br/>
better housing, and - often backed by money <br/>
from philanthropists - commissioned archi-<br/>
tects to find alternatives to the traditional <br/>
tenement building. The City and Suburban<br/>
Homes, the major project of a limited-profit<br/>
company underwritten by members of <br/>
the Astor, Lewisohn, Auchincloss, Rockefel-<br/>
ler and Iselin families, was the largest of the <br/>
so-called model tenements built in New York, <br/>
and one of the best. This group of six-sto-<br/>
ry walk-up buildings, erected around a series<br/>
of private courtyards, was designed to assure<br/>
every family light, air, privacy, and a sense of <br/>
space. To an urban environment that had <br/>
symbolized only harshness to many people, <br/>
this complex brought dignity and joy. <br/>
<br/>
   All of this is significant today because the <br/>
City and Suburban Homes, which as gone on <br/>
housing people well for the better part of a <br/>
century, is now threatened. An island of <br/>
working-class people in the midst of the very <br/>
gentrified Upper East Side, it may well give <br/>
way to yet another luxury tower containing <br/>
yet more luxury apartments. The <br/>
structures were purchased in 1985 for $43<br/>
million by Peter Kalikow, the real-estate de-<br/>
veloper, who announced plans to evict all of <br/>
the tenants and replace the old build-<br/>
ings with four 40-story towers; the immensi-<br/>
ty of the public outcry against that proposal<br/>
led Mr. Kalikow to put forth a reduced plan<br/>
under which only one 65-story tower would be <br/>
built, at the easternmost end of the site over-<br/>
looking the East River, and the rest of the <br/>
complex would be retained. Tenants who<br/>
would lose their apartments to make way for<br/>
the new building would be moved into the sec-<br/>
tions of the project that were to be kept.<br/>
   The revised plan, though it does call for sav-<br/>
ing the majority of the apartments, would still<br/>
cut the heart out of the complex. The old build-<br/>
ings, already hemmed in on many sides<br/>
by new apartment towers, would be over-<br/>
whelmed by the huge monolith on their own<br/>
site. The plan satisfied neither the tenants of <br/>
the City and Suburban Homes nor a coalition of<br/>
community groups, who have continued to ob-<br/>
ject to Mr. Kalikow's project. The opponents<br/>
have succeeded in convincing the Land-<br/>
makrs Preservation Commission that the City<br/>
and Suburban Homes is a worthy candidate for <br/>
landmark status, and the commission plans to <br/>
hold a hearing on Thursday. If the build-<br/>
ings are so designated, Mr. Kalikow would <br/>
need the commission's approval to proceed<br/>
with any version of his plan. <br/>
   Although the City and Suburban Homes'<br/>
somewhat similar neighbor, the Cherokee <br/>
Apartments, has been a landmark for sev-<br/>
eral years, the City and Suburban <br/>
Homes is not, at first glance, a typical city<br/>
landmark. The buildings are not beautiful by<br/>
conventional standards (although there is<br/>
some decorative detail on them, they are a <br/>
goot bit less ornate than the Cherokee Apart-<br/>
ments, and their beige brick makes them<br/>
look plain, even banal, from the street).<br/>
Whether it is a matter of unintentional dis-<br/>
crimination against the poor or a more inno-<br/>
cent tendency to think of landmarks in terms<br/>
of the fantasies and dreams about the<br/>
city that they can inspire, New York has tend-<br/>
ed to favor elaborate buildings for landmark<br/>
status, either public structures or buildings de-k<br/>
signed for the rich. If you think of land-<br/>
marks only as celebrations of the city's roman-<br/>
tic imagery, there is not much that is romantic<br/>
about a tenement - even a modeltenement.<br/>
   But no view could be more shortsighted, or <br/>
more limiting of what landmark status<br/>
should signify. These structures, whichc were <br/>
designed by several architectural forms of <br/>
which the best known are Harde & Short and <br/>
Percy Griffith, represent the city's best in-<br/>
tentions - a commitment on the part of the <br/>
city's upper class, and its architects, to solv-<br/>
ing social problems. The City and Suburban <br/>
Homes are not elegant in the way that so <br/>
much of the city's turn-of-the-century archi-<br/>
tecture was elegant. But they are not bad as <br/>
works of design, either. And no structures re-<br/>
flect nobler aspirations.<br/>
   And today, if New York needs anything, it <br/>
is some reminders that architecture can stand <br/>
for the public good. For this is a time that is in <br/>
one way not so very different from the era in <br/>
which the City and Suburban Homes was built <br/>
in both periods, the city's housing prob-<br/>
lem has been acute. In the early years of this <br/>
century, the problem could be put mainly in <br/>
terms of the quality of housing - conditions <br/>
in the slums were appalling, and even most <br/>
new buildings were constructed to stan-<br/>
dards that can obly be called indifferent to <br/>
human needs. Now, housing units are more <br/>
civilized - the problem is that we do not <br/>
build enough of them, and that many people <br/>
are without housing altogether. <br/>
   The most striking difference between the <br/>
years the City and Suburban Homes was built <br/>
and today is the extent to which in the earlier <br/>
era the private esctor appeared commit-<br/>
ted to trying to solve the problem. The fam-<br/>
ilieswho organized the City and Suburban<br/>
Homes Company - which built smaller proj-<br/>
ects between its founding in 1896 and the start <br/>
of the huge East 79th Street complex in 1901 - <br/>
wanted not only to help the families who <br/>
would live in their buildings but also to inspire<br/>
other, more profit-minded builders to raise <br/>
the standards of their housing. They recog-<br/>
nized that the free market, acting on its own, <br/>
would do little unless it was pushed. It <br/>
would be another generation before the onset <br/>
of public housing, bringing the government <br/>
into the business of creating improved hous-<br/>
ing for the poor; until that time, the City<br/>
and Suburban Homes was the largest single <br/>
effort in the New York or any other city to create <br/>
decent housing for the poor. These apart-<br/>
ments are monuments to possibility - to the <br/>
belief that architecture can make city life de-<br/>
cent for working people.<br/>
   Today with only tiny amounts of publicly <br/>
assisted housing being constructed, we seem <br/>
in some ways to have slid almost all the way <br/>
back to the era before City and Subur- <br/>
ban Houses was even built, content to let the <br/>
free market do what it wishes. That all too of- <br/>
ten means building housing for the well-to-do, <br/>
and letting others struggle as best they <br/>
can. And where better to see that process at <br/>
work than on the site of the City and Suburban <br/>
Houses on the Upper East Side? It is ironic in-<br/>
deed that the City and Suburban Houses, <br/>
a philanthropic testament to better housing <br/>
conditions created because the real-estate <br/>
market on its own could not do what was neces-<br/>
sary, might well be altered or destroyed by <br/>
those very same market forces - come back <br/>
to haunt it nearly a century later.
